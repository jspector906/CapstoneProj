SMILE

Definition of my audience: The target audience for this project will be teachers, mentors, classmates, tech recruiters, hiring managers, and the actual consumer of my product.

Definition statement: I want to create a web application that makes people feel happy and puts a smile on their face. This will be done through sharing pictures of people smiling, and cute pictures of animals. Also, videos of people doing good deeds for one another, and a section for positive news that are happening locally and internationally.

Elevator pitch: The Smile App - This App is guaranteed to put and keep a smile on your face. With our collection of pictures, videos, and stories from across the world, it is easy to share your favorites. Show them to friends, family, and whoever may enjoy our upbeat content. Whenever you are feeling stressed or blue, come to our app and you will feel much better before you leave.

Outline of the content: The app will be split into three different sections. Pics, Vids, and News. Vids that share news will also be placed in the news section. Developers will place their favorite content at the top of the page, and will take feedback from users on which content they prefer most. Users will be allowed to post their own content and see other users content. Each submission will be reviewed by staff or eventually by AI that makes sure it complies with all the rules. There will be no likes or comments, as this takes away from the app objective. In order to make profit, users will be able to buy some of the pictures, originals or cleared for use/sale. Also will be able to buy clothing with pics and app logos. Possible monthly subscriptions to boost your posts to the top of the feed.
