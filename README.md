# Smile.ly

**Definition of my audience:** _The target audience for this project will be teachers, mentors, classmates, tech recruiters, hiring managers, and the actual consumer of my product._

**Definition statement:** _I want to create a web application that makes people feel connected, happy, and puts a smile on their face for the rest of the day, not just temporarily._

**Elevator pitch:** _Smile.ly - Who turns to social media when you're bored? What do you see? A collection of advertisements, negative hate comments, and repetitive content. Smile.ly is guaranteed to put and keep a smile on your face. With a collection of custom pictures, videos, and stories from across the world, it is easy to share your favorites. Show them to friends, family, and whoever may enjoy our upbeat content. Whenever you are feeling stressed or bored, come to our app and you will feel refreshed before you leave._

**Outline of the content:** _The app will be split into three different sections. Pics, Vids, and News. Vids that share news will also be placed in the news section. Users will be allowed to post their own content and see other users' content. Each submission will be reviewed by staff or eventually by AI that makes sure it complies with all the rules. The main rules are that each post has to be inspiring, educational, or funny. Random posts about what you are for breakfast, or why Donald Trump is the worst - will not be approved. If you want to share a recipe of your breakfast, that is educational. Developers will take feedback from users on which content they prefer most. There will be no likes or comments, as this takes away from the apps purpose. Instead, there will be smileys. A user can leave 1 smiley on someones post. In order to make profit, users will be able to buy some of the pictures, originals or cleared for use/sale. Also will be able to buy merchandise with pics and app logos. Monthly subscriptions to boost your posts to the top of the feed._
